<h1>TULIP THOERY</h1>
<HR>
    <P>The acronym TULIP stands for Total Depravity, Unconditional Election, Limited Atonement, Irresistible Grace, and Perseverance of the Saints. Sadly, many today have never even heard of these Doctrines of Grace, while others revile these beautiful Biblical truths by calling them ungracious and unloving. They think of God as an unaffectionate despot rather than the essence of love Himself.

        Most who revile the Doctrines of Grace hate God’s sovereign election of sinners. The reason for this hatred is straightforward: man from the very beginning has wanted to be God. The tempter caught our first parents with the lie that “You will be like God” (Gen. 3:5). The same weakness persists today as man desires to be in control of his own salvation.
        
        Let us walk through each point of the acronym TULIP to demonstrate how to encounter God’s lovingkindness in these great Doctrines of Grace, also known as Calvinism.</P>
