<h1>ROSE THEORY</h1>
<HR>
<P>During the Victorian era of the 19th century, lovers would use floriography, or ‘the language of flowers’, to send covert messages to each other via posies known as tussie-mussies or nosegays. In this unique floral dictionary, the red rose symbolises love, passion, romance and devotion. It was used to simply and proudly say, “I love you”, at a time when the verbal expression of such sentiments was deemed socially inappropriate.  

    Other colours of roses have their own similar, yet subtly different, meanings. Pink roses represent affection and admiration, making them a good choice for budding relationships, while white roses symbolise purity and are still popular at weddings and funerals today. Yellow roses reflect friendship. Whatever you do, steer clear of black (actually very dark red) roses, as they have a long association with death!
